A software product line (SPL) is a set of software products that share a common, managed set of features and that together with the needs of a particular market segment or mission. They are developed from a common set of core assets in a planned way. By developing large software systems in this way companies can produce a set of products more economically since the development effort put into shared assets need not be duplicated. SPLs can also help companies to better address product custom tasks to meet specific needs or individual customers. This makes it possible to sustain a high rate of product innovation, while keeping guaranteed levels of overall system performance and quality. The fundamental concept of a software product line is a domain specific product architecture based on a layered set of platforms.
